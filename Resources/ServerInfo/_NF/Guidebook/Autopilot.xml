  The [color=#a4885c]autopilot system[/color] allows your shuttle to automatically navigate to a target destination without manual piloting. This feature is particularly useful for long-distance travel across the sector.

  ## Requirements
  To use the autopilot system, your shuttle must have an [color=#a4885c]autopilot server[/color] installed. This is a machine that can be researched and constructed through the Engineering research tree.

  ## Using Autopilot

  </Box>
  To engage the autopilot:

  1. Open the [color=#a4885c]shuttle console[/color] in your cockpit.
  2. Select a target destination on the radar (such as a POI, station, or another ship).
  3. Click the [color=#a4885c]"Enable Autopilot"[/color] button at the top of the console right click menu.

  Once engaged, the autopilot will:
  - Automatically calculate the flight path to your target
  - Navigate around obstacles
  - Maintain safe velocity during travel (60% of max speed)
  - Slow down as it approaches the destination

  ## Disengaging Autopilot
  The autopilot will automatically disengage when:
  - You manually pilot the shuttle (press any movement or rotation keys)
  - You click the [color=#a4885c]"Disable Autopilot"[/color] button
  - The shuttle reaches its destination

  ## Safety Notes
  - The autopilot cannot dock for you - you must manually dock when you reach your destination
  - Always monitor your shuttle while autopilot is active
  - The autopilot may not react to sudden threats or changes in the environment
  - Announce your intended route over the traffic channel ([color=#CC6633]:d[/color]) before engaging autopilot for long journeys
